<div id="abouttext">I took an interest into gaming at a young age, maybe around 5 years old. The child that watched as his siblings
took hold of a different world created by others. The idea of gaming is definitely not easy, especially for the competitive
scene. Thats when people that think they're skilled in whatever game tries to show their skill to see if they place as number 1.
